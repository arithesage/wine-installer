3Dfx splash dlls for Glide

Copy these dlls either to

- Windows\SysWOW64          folder (64 bit Windows OS)
- Windows\System32          folder (32 bit Windows OS)

or to the game folder if you want 3Dfx splash screen or
3Dfx watermark (shameless plug) through dgVoodoo.

3dfxspl2.dll        is for Glide2x.dll
3dfxspl3.dll        is for Glide3x.dll

(Glide.dll has no splash counterpart as far as I know)
